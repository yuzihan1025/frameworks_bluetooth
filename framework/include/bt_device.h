 * @brief Get the BLE Identity Address of a remote device.
 *
 * Retrieves the BLE Identity Address (`id_addr`) of a remote device. The Identity Address is a fixed
 * BLE address used to identify the device, distinct from the current BLE address (`bd_addr`) when
 * privacy features such as Resolvable Private Address (RPA) are enabled.
 *
 * @param ins - Bluetooth client instance, see @ref bt_instance_t.
 * @param bd_addr - Current BLE address of the remote device:
 *                  - Public Device Address
 *                  - Random Device Address (Static or Resolvable Private Address)
 * @param[out] id_addr - Pointer to store the Identity Address, which will be one of:
 *                       - Public Device Address
 *                       - Static Random Address
 *
 * @return bt_status_t
 *         - `BT_STATUS_SUCCESS`: Successfully retrieved the Identity Address.
 *         - Negative error code: Operation failed (e.g., invalid address or device not found).
 *
 * @note **Difference Between `bd_addr` and `id_addr`:**
 *       - **`bd_addr`**: The device's current BLE connection address, which may change if privacy
 *         features such as RPA are used. It is used for ongoing communication.
 *       - **`id_addr`**: The stable Identity Address, which will always be one of:
 *         - **Public Device Address**: Globally unique and assigned by the manufacturer.
 *         - **Static Random Address**: Fixed and randomly generated, persistent across power cycles.
 *
 * @note **Bluetooth Address Details:**
 *       - **Public Device Address**: Globally unique address assigned by the manufacturer, also used
 *         as BD_ADDR for BR/EDR devices.
 *       - **Random Device Address**: Includes:
 *         - **Static Address**: Fixed random address when privacy is not enabled.
 *         - **Resolvable Private Address (RPA)**: Temporary address used for privacy, resolved to
 *           the Identity Address using the IRK (Identity Resolving Key).
 *       - **Identity Address**: A fixed address used to identify the device.
 *
 *       The Identity Address is typically obtained during pairing and stored for future use.
 *
 * **Example:**
 * @code
bt_address_t bd_addr; // Current BLE connection address
bt_address_t id_addr; // Identity Address to retrieve
if (bt_device_get_identity_address(ins, &bd_addr, &id_addr) == BT_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
